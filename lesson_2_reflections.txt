What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
>> Git prepares all metadta/setups needs to have new clean repository  & creates .git directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>> Adding to staging aread (git add) will add the file sin a group to be tracked by git for next commit together. Allows logical grouping of files in a single commit (to commit related changes together in one atomic commit).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
>> Allows you to compare the changes staged & ready for commit & compare the difference with repository before committing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
>> when we need to experiment on some features, not yet ready to go one master branch, until tested or certain logical point is nreached. Or, if we ewant to maintain two version of code??

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
>> Helps us to visualize the complicated tree structure if we have many branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
>> It takes the changes in one branch with respect to the common starting points between two branches and merged to the other branch ( the branch which is checked out).The new branch after merging will contain changes from both branches. Hence we show as a merging of two in diagram

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Auto merged can fail when we have conflict & then we need to go and start cleaning up manually. If we do manual merged, merges are clean with just branch level content merge.
